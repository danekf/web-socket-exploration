<h1 align="center">Web Sockets, a mystery to be solved.</h3>
<br>

<a name="Intro"></a>

<p>As developers, we need to remain aware of the use cases and limitations of the communication protocols we use. Each protocol will have its own pros/cons. Differences include, but are not limited to, how a protocol handles encoding, confirmation of receipt, error handling, flow control, queuing, etc...

As web developpers we deal mostly with the client-server model. And we are most familiar with HTTP protocol. However there is another option that is favoured when a site requires specific features such as integrated chat. That protocol is called Web Socket.

This repository aims to explore web sockets on a high level through explanation and demonstration.

## What is the client/server model?
<p>Prior to diving into Web Socket, it is important to briefly go over how a client/server model functions on a high level.</p>
<p>In this model, data is stored and managed by a server. This data could be login information,a database of products, a database of client information, web pages, or any other information that someone might want to access.</p>
<p>The client is the end user who wants to access or modify this data.</p>
<br>
<p>In order to use that data the client will make a request to the server, and the server will respond withthe formatted data. The major difference between an HTTP request and a web socket is with how exactly this communication is established.</p>
