<a name="Intro"></a>

<p>As developers, we need to remain aware of the use cases and limitations of the communication protocols we use. Each protocol will have its own pros/cons. Differences include, but are not limited to, how a protocol handles encoding, confirmation of receipt, error handling, flow control, queuing, etc...

As web developpers we deal mostly with the client-server model. And we are most familiar with HTTP protocol. However there is another option that is favoured when a site requires specific features such as integrated chat. That protocol is called Web Socket.
